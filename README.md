# PWNG Client

pwng-client is a default client for displaying information from a galaxy-down-to-rigid-body simulation engine pwng will eventually become.

See **[pwng-server](https://github.com/planeworld/pwng-server)** for detailed documentation about Planeworld NG.

This readme will mainly be populated with information that is client specific. All information concerning the simulation, the application protocol, and the project itself can be found in the [pwng-server](https://github.com/planeworld/pwng-server) repository! A teaser can be seen in the following Figure 1:
