Based on my positive experiences with my other project [BattleSub](https://github.com/bfeldpw/battlesub) with [Magnum](https://github.com/mosra/magnum) and [EnTT](https://github.com/skypjack/entt) I decided to restart my favorite project [Planeworld](https://github.com/planeworld/planeworld) by consequently using a client server mechanic, an ECS (EnTT) and a graphics (and much more) middleware (Magnum Graphics).

This readme will mainly be populated with information that is client specific. All information concerning the simulation, the application protocol, and the project itself can be found in the [pwng-server](https://github.com/planeworld/pwng-server) repository!
